Discussion on whether we should allow borrowing in addition to trading?
	Stories seem to support borrowing, but lending cards doesn't make sense
	Need to confirm that requirements dont mandate borrowing

Went over the UI design
	Need To Add:
		Trade instance activity
		Configuration activity (offline viewing, making trades. Enable downloading of images)
	
How will people chat/ coordinate to trade?
	Add a trade dialog/ messaging system to a trade activity

What picture to put in the item page? Real Picture/ stock picture
	Album would be ideal, could combine images from multiple sources (online/ taken on phone)

Project Actors:
	Cards
	Inventory
	Users -> User, Friends
	Profile
	Photograph

Card Categories:
	Magic The Gathering
	Pokemon
	Yu-Gi-Oh
	Digimon
	Sports
	Steam Trading Card
	Cards Against Humanity
	Super Fight
	Animal Crossing
	Shrek Trading Cards

TODO:
	Elias: write requirements test cases for "browse search inventories of friends photograph of items"
	Aaron: write requirements test cases for "trade with friends"
	Jake: write requirements test cases for "offline behaviour and configuration"
	Josh: write requirements test cases for "inventory"
	Salim: write requirements test cases for "friends"
	Anson: finish UI prototyping
