Joshua lost his mailbox...

Since Last Time

-Salim, implemeted trades was working on UML. Anson was hampering his success.
-Anson, contributed to UML, mostly did gui tests. Most of GUI is implemented. Want to make sure gui is consistent. Salim is blocking him, and time constraints.
-Jake, implemented the controllers. Starting to work on 
-Joshua, implemented the trades classes. Not entirely complete since we dont have a network implementation. For adding data to User use the User mehtods instead of the inventory methods. Time constraints are blocking.
-Aaron, worked alot on the UML (MVC). Worked with Anson to finalize what controllers we need for the views. For next week, add skeletons of the UML classes we dont have implemented yet. 4 Other projects are blocking.
-Elias, worked on UML and Javadoc. Want to work on JUnit tests for model for project part 4.
-Stephen, did 5 person project by himself. Collected data a wrote bash scripts to process data. Data was erased before he could use scripts.

Discussion on whether we should allow borrowing in addition to trading?
	Stories seem to support borrowing, but lending cards doesn't make sense
	Need to confirm that requirements dont mandate borrowing

Went over the UI design
	Need To Add:
		Trade instance activity
		Configuration activity (offline viewing, making trades. Enable downloading of images)
	
How will people chat/ coordinate to trade?
	Add a trade dialog/ messaging system to a trade activity

What picture to put in the item page? Real Picture/ stock picture
	Album would be ideal, could combine images from multiple sources (online/ taken on phone)

Project Actors:
	Cards
	Inventory
	Users -> User, Friends
	Profile
	Photograph

Card Categories:
	Magic The Gathering
	Pokemon
	Yu-Gi-Oh
	Digimon
	Sports
	Steam Trading Card
	Cards Against Humanity
	Super Fight
	Animal Crossing
	Shrek Trading Cards

TODO:
	Elias: write requirements test cases for "browse search inventories of friends photograph of items"
	Aaron: write requirements test cases for "trade with friends"
	Jake: write requirements test cases for "offline behaviour and configuration"
	Josh: write requirements test cases for "inventory"
	Salim: write requirements test cases for "friends"
	Anson: finish UI prototyping
