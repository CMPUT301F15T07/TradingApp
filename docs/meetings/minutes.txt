Discussion on whether we should allow borrowing in addition to trading?
	Stories seem to support borrowing, but lending cards doesn't make sense
	Need to confirm that requirements dont mandate borrowing

Went over the UI design
	Need To Add:
		Trade instance activity
		Configuration activity (offline viewing, making trades. Enable downloading of images)
	
How will people chat/ coordinate to trade?
	Add a trade dialog/ messaging system to a trade activity

What picture to put in the item page? Real Picture/ stock picture
	Album would be ideal, could combine images from multiple sources (online/ taken on phone)
